# Google OAuth Implementation (Optional Advanced Challenge)

## Description
Implement Google OAuth 2.0 authentication as the optional advanced feature. This adds significant value but is only tackled if time permits after core functionality is complete.

## Objectives
- Set up Google OAuth 2.0 with NextAuth.js
- Implement login/logout functionality
- Add user session management to Redux store
- Create protected route wrapper (optional)
- Ensure modular integration with existing code

## Steps
1. Set up Google OAuth configuration:
   - Create Google Cloud Console project
   - Configure OAuth 2.0 credentials
   - Set up authorized redirect URIs
2. Install and configure NextAuth.js:
   - `npm install next-auth`
   - Create `src/app/api/auth/[...nextauth]/route.ts`
   - Configure Google provider
3. Update environment variables:
   - Add GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID and GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET
   - Update .env.local.example with OAuth setup instructions
   - Configure NEXTAUTH_URL and NEXTAUTH_SECRET
4. Integrate with Redux store:
   - Extend user slice with authentication state
   - Add session management actions
   - Connect NextAuth session with Redux
5. Create authentication UI components:
   - Login button with Google branding
   - User profile display (name, email, avatar)
   - Logout functionality
   - Session status indicators
6. Optional protected route implementation:
   - Wrap main page with authentication check
   - Redirect to login if not authenticated
   - Handle loading states during auth check
7. Update layout with authentication UI:
   - Header with login/logout controls
   - User avatar and name display
   - Responsive design for auth elements

## Progress
- [ ] Google Cloud Console project set up
- [ ] NextAuth.js installed and configured
- [ ] Environment variables configured
- [ ] Redux store updated for authentication
- [ ] Login/logout UI components created
- [ ] Session management implemented
- [ ] Optional protected routes added
- [ ] Authentication fully tested

## Dependencies
- TASK-010 (Deployment to Vercel) must be completed
- Only implement if core features are solid and time permits

## Notes
- This is the optional advanced challenge - only implement if time allows
- Focus on clean integration with existing architecture
- Ensure the app works without authentication as fallback
- Document OAuth setup process clearly in README
- Test with real Google accounts

## Next Steps
- Complete only if time permits and core app is fully functional
- Final code review and cleanup
- Update submission documentation with OAuth features
- Performance testing with authentication enabled
