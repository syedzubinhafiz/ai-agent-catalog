# Client-side Filtering Implementation

## Description
Implement all required client-side filtering features including search bar, status filter, category filter, pricing model filter, and clear all functionality.

## Objectives
- Create SearchBar component with real-time filtering
- Implement multi-select filters for status and category
- Create single-select filter for pricing model
- Add "Clear All Filters" functionality
- Ensure smooth user experience with proper debouncing
- Display filter counts and active filter indicators

## Steps
1. Create `src/components/SearchBar.tsx`:
   - Real-time search input with debouncing
   - Search by agent name and description (case-insensitive)
   - Clear search functionality
   - Search icon and proper accessibility
2. Create `src/components/FilterControls.tsx`:
   - Status filter (checkboxes for Active, Beta, Archived)
   - Category filter (checkboxes for all unique categories)
   - Pricing model filter (radio buttons or select)
   - Clear all filters button
3. Install additional Shadcn components:
   - `npx shadcn-ui@latest add input`
   - `npx shadcn-ui@latest add checkbox`
   - `npx shadcn-ui@latest add select`
4. Create filtering utilities in `src/lib/filters.ts`:
   - `filterAgents()` function
   - Search matching logic
   - Multi-criteria filtering logic
5. Update main page to be client component for filtering
6. Implement filter results display:
   - Show number of filtered results
   - Display active filters
   - Empty state when no results match
7. Add URL state management (optional enhancement)

## Progress
- [ ] SearchBar component with debouncing
- [ ] Status filter with multi-select checkboxes
- [ ] Category filter with dynamic options
- [ ] Pricing model filter implementation
- [ ] Clear all filters functionality
- [ ] Filter utilities and logic completed
- [ ] Results count and active filter display
- [ ] Empty state handling for no results

## Dependencies
- TASK-006 (Redux Store Setup) must be completed

## Notes
- Use 300ms debouncing for search input
- Extract unique categories dynamically from agent data
- Maintain filter state in Redux for consistency
- Consider performance with larger datasets
- Ensure accessibility for all filter controls

## Next Steps
- Move to TASK-008 (Framer Motion Animations) once complete
- Performance testing with heavy filtering
- User experience testing with various filter combinations
