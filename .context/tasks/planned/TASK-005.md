# Initial Responsive Design and Layout Polish

## Description
Implement responsive design across all screen sizes and polish the initial layout. This completes the 50% milestone for tonight, ensuring the basic application works well on all devices.

## Objectives
- Ensure responsive design across mobile, tablet, and desktop
- Implement proper spacing and typography
- Test layout with different content lengths
- Add basic loading states and empty states
- Optimize for performance and accessibility

## Steps
1. Implement responsive breakpoints:
   - Mobile: 1 column grid, larger cards
   - Tablet: 2-3 column grid, medium cards
   - Desktop: 3-4 column grid, compact cards
2. Typography and spacing:
   - Consistent font sizes and line heights
   - Proper spacing between elements
   - Readable text hierarchy
3. Add container and layout components:
   - Main container with max-width
   - Proper padding and margins
   - Header/navigation placeholder for future features
4. Handle edge cases:
   - Long agent names and descriptions
   - Empty states (no agents found)
   - Loading states (skeleton components)
5. Basic performance optimizations:
   - Image optimization setup (for future icons)
   - CSS purging with Tailwind
6. Accessibility improvements:
   - Proper semantic HTML
   - ARIA labels where needed
   - Keyboard navigation support
7. Test across devices and browsers

## Progress
- [ ] Responsive breakpoints implemented
- [ ] Typography and spacing finalized
- [ ] Container and layout components created
- [ ] Edge cases handled (long text, empty states)
- [ ] Loading states implemented
- [ ] Performance optimizations applied
- [ ] Accessibility features tested
- [ ] Cross-device testing completed

## Dependencies
- TASK-004 (Core UI Components) must be completed

## Notes
- This task completes Phase 1 (50% milestone for tonight)
- Focus on solid foundation rather than perfect polish
- Test on actual devices, not just browser dev tools
- Document any responsive design decisions for consistency

## Next Steps
- Phase 1 complete - ready for Phase 2 tomorrow
- Move to TASK-006 (Redux Store Setup) for Phase 2
- Conduct Phase 1 review and testing session
- Deploy Phase 1 version to Vercel for early feedback
