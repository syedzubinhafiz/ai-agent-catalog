# Redux Store Setup and Integration

## Description
Set up Redux Toolkit store with proper TypeScript integration and prepare for client-side filtering functionality. Keep the store minimal and focused on filtering state management.

## Objectives
- Configure Redux Toolkit store with TypeScript
- Create filter slice for search and filter states
- Set up Redux Provider in the app
- Prepare store structure for future OAuth user state
- Ensure SSR compatibility

## Steps
1. Create Redux store structure in `src/lib/store/`:
   - `store.ts` - Configure store with middleware
   - `filterSlice.ts` - Search and filter state management
   - `types.ts` - Redux-related type definitions
   - `hooks.ts` - Typed useAppDispatch and useAppSelector
2. Implement filter slice with:
   - Search query state
   - Status filter state (multiple selection)
   - Category filter state (multiple selection)
   - Pricing model filter state (single selection)
   - Actions for updating filters
   - Actions for clearing all filters
3. Set up Redux Provider in `src/app/layout.tsx`
4. Create store provider component for client-side usage
5. Prepare user slice structure (empty, for future OAuth)
6. Ensure proper TypeScript integration
7. Test store functionality with basic component

## Progress
- [ ] Redux Toolkit store configured
- [ ] Filter slice implemented with all filter types
- [ ] Redux Provider set up in app layout
- [ ] TypeScript integration complete
- [ ] Store hooks created and typed
- [ ] User slice structure prepared
- [ ] Basic store functionality tested

## Dependencies
- TASK-005 (Initial Responsive Design) must be completed

## Notes
- Keep store minimal - only filter state and future user state
- Use Redux Toolkit for reduced boilerplate
- Ensure SSR compatibility by using client components where needed
- Structure user slice for easy OAuth integration tomorrow

## Next Steps
- Move to TASK-007 (Client-side Filtering Implementation) once complete
- Test store performance with filter state changes
- Verify TypeScript compliance across store implementation
