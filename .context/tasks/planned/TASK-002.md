# Mock Data Setup and TypeScript Interfaces

## Description
Create the mock data file, define TypeScript interfaces for the AI agents, and set up data fetching utilities for server-side rendering.

## Objectives
- Create mock-agents.json with provided data
- Define comprehensive TypeScript interfaces
- Create data fetching utilities
- Set up server-side data loading simulation
- Ensure type safety across the application

## Steps
1. Create `src/data/mock-agents.json` with the provided agent data
2. Define TypeScript interfaces in `src/lib/types.ts`:
   - `Agent` interface
   - `AgentStatus` type
   - `AgentCategory` type
   - `PricingModel` type
   - Filter-related types
3. Create `src/lib/data.ts` with:
   - `getAgents()` function for SSR
   - Simulated async delay for realistic API behavior
   - Error handling and type safety
4. Create utility functions for filtering and searching
5. Export all types and functions with proper documentation

## Progress
- [ ] Mock data file created
- [ ] TypeScript interfaces defined
- [ ] Data fetching utilities created
- [ ] Server-side data loading function implemented
- [ ] Type safety verified
- [ ] Utility functions for filtering created

## Dependencies
- TASK-001 (Project Setup) must be completed

## Notes
- Include all 10 agents from the provided mock data
- Use proper TypeScript strict mode compliance
- Add JSDoc comments for better developer experience
- Design interfaces to be extensible for future OAuth user data

## Next Steps
- Move to TASK-003 (Basic Agent Listing Page) once complete
- Test data loading in a simple component to verify functionality
