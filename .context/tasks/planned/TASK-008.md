# Framer Motion Animations Implementation

## Description
Add subtle and smooth animations using Framer Motion to enhance user experience. Focus on meaningful animations that improve usability rather than decoration.

## Objectives
- Implement card entry animations for agent grid
- Add smooth hover effects on agent cards
- Create filter transition animations
- Add loading state animations
- Ensure animations are performant and accessible

## Steps
1. Configure Framer Motion for Next.js App Router:
   - Ensure client-side components where needed
   - Set up proper import optimization
2. Implement agent card animations:
   - Stagger animation for grid entry (cards appear sequentially)
   - Hover animations (scale, shadow, or glow effects)
   - Card flip or slide animation on filter changes
3. Add filter control animations:
   - Smooth transitions when filters are applied
   - Count number changes with counter animation
   - Clear filters button interaction feedback
4. Implement page transition animations:
   - Fade-in for initial page load
   - Loading skeleton animations
   - Empty state animations
5. Add micro-interactions:
   - Button press animations
   - Input focus animations
   - Badge color transitions
6. Performance optimizations:
   - Use transform properties for better performance
   - Reduce motion for accessibility (prefers-reduced-motion)
   - Optimize animation timing and easing

## Progress
- [ ] Framer Motion configured for Next.js
- [ ] Agent card stagger animations
- [ ] Hover effects implemented
- [ ] Filter transition animations
- [ ] Loading state animations
- [ ] Micro-interactions added
- [ ] Performance and accessibility optimized

## Dependencies
- TASK-007 (Client-side Filtering) must be completed

## Notes
- Keep animations subtle and purposeful
- Test performance on lower-end devices
- Respect prefers-reduced-motion setting
- Animations should enhance, not distract from, content
- Use hardware-accelerated transforms when possible

## Next Steps
- Move to TASK-009 (SEO Optimization) once complete
- User testing for animation preferences
- Performance testing with animations enabled
