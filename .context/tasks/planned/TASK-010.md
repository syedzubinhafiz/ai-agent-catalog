# Deployment to Vercel

## Description
Deploy the AI Agent Catalog application to Vercel for production hosting. Ensure proper configuration, environment variables, and performance optimization for the live environment.

## Objectives
- Deploy application to Vercel with automatic deployments
- Configure production environment variables
- Set up custom domain (if available)
- Optimize build configuration for performance
- Test production deployment thoroughly

## Steps
1. Prepare deployment configuration:
   - Verify `package.json` build scripts
   - Create `vercel.json` if needed for custom configuration
   - Ensure all environment variables are documented
2. Set up Vercel project:
   - Connect GitHub repository to Vercel
   - Configure build settings (Next.js preset)
   - Set up automatic deployments for main branch
3. Configure environment variables:
   - Add production environment variables to Vercel dashboard
   - Verify .env.local.example is comprehensive
   - Test environment variable loading
4. Optimize production build:
   - Enable Vercel Analytics (if desired)
   - Configure caching strategies
   - Verify bundle optimization
5. Post-deployment testing:
   - Test all functionality in production environment
   - Verify SSR is working correctly
   - Check performance with Lighthouse
   - Test on different devices and browsers
6. Set up monitoring:
   - Configure error tracking (if needed)
   - Set up performance monitoring
   - Verify logs and analytics
7. Document deployment process and URLs

## Progress
- [ ] Deployment configuration prepared
- [ ] Vercel project connected to GitHub
- [ ] Environment variables configured
- [ ] Production build optimized
- [ ] Application successfully deployed
- [ ] Post-deployment testing completed
- [ ] Monitoring and analytics set up

## Dependencies
- TASK-009 (SEO Optimization) must be completed

## Notes
- Use Vercel's Next.js preset for optimal configuration
- Test deployment with both main and preview branches
- Ensure SSR functionality works in production
- Document live URL for submission
- Keep deployment simple and reliable

## Next Steps
- Move to TASK-011 (Google OAuth Implementation) if time permits
- Final testing and quality assurance
- Prepare submission documentation
- Performance optimization based on production data
