# Basic SSR Agent Listing Page

## Description
Implement the main page with Server-Side Rendering that displays the AI agent list. This is the core functionality that demonstrates SSR capability and initial data loading.

## Objectives
- Create main page component with SSR data fetching
- Implement basic layout and structure
- Ensure agents are pre-rendered on the server
- Verify SSR by checking page source
- Set up basic SEO meta tags

## Steps
1. Create `src/app/page.tsx` as a Server Component
2. Implement direct data fetching using the `getAgents()` function
3. Create basic page layout with:
   - Page title and description
   - Agent count display
   - Container for agent grid
4. Set up basic SEO in `src/app/layout.tsx`:
   - Dynamic page title
   - Meta description
   - Viewport and other essential tags
5. Add error boundary and loading states
6. Test SSR by viewing page source (agents should appear in HTML)
7. Ensure TypeScript compliance and proper error handling

## Progress
- [ ] Main page component created
- [ ] SSR data fetching implemented
- [ ] Basic layout structure complete
- [ ] SEO meta tags configured
- [ ] Error handling implemented
- [ ] SSR functionality verified
- [ ] TypeScript compliance checked

## Dependencies
- TASK-002 (Mock Data Setup) must be completed

## Notes
- Use Server Components (not 'use client') for SSR
- Keep page component minimal and focused on data fetching
- Verify SSR by checking "View Page Source" in browser
- Page should work without JavaScript enabled

## Next Steps
- Move to TASK-004 (Core UI Components) once complete
- Test page loading performance and initial render
- Verify agents appear in HTML source code
