# Core UI Components with Shadcn

## Description
Create the essential UI components for displaying AI agents using Shadcn UI components. Focus on clean, reusable components that will form the foundation of the application.

## Objectives
- Install and configure necessary Shadcn components
- Create AgentCard component with all required information
- Create AgentGrid component for responsive layout
- Implement status badges and category tags
- Ensure responsive design across devices

## Steps
1. Install required Shadcn components:
   - `npx shadcn-ui@latest add card`
   - `npx shadcn-ui@latest add badge`
   - `npx shadcn-ui@latest add button`
2. Create `src/components/AgentCard.tsx`:
   - Display agent name, description, status, category, pricing
   - Use Shadcn Card component
   - Add status badge with appropriate colors
   - Include placeholder for agent icon/initials
3. Create `src/components/AgentGrid.tsx`:
   - Responsive grid layout (1 col mobile, 2-3 cols tablet, 3-4 cols desktop)
   - Use CSS Grid with Tailwind classes
   - Handle empty states
4. Create utility components:
   - StatusBadge component with color coding
   - CategoryTag component
